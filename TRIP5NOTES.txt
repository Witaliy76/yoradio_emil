NEXT:

MAYBE:

Still unresponsive one-buttons when volume is displaying?
Screensaver fixed for OLED (I think it's already in)
Long-press volume / channel disable?

Maybe print mDNS to screen (IP is still needed)

FLAC files should be just restarted (don't resume correctly)?
Feedback windows?
Delete currently uses...
	}else{
	  alert('Choose something first');
	}

Maybe we can style a custom popup that can be used to relay information from netserver?
